## 📌 **Purpose**

The **Integrator** exists to unify strategy, systems, and operations across all departments.  
They takes ideas, goals, and standards — and turns them into real, working systems through implementation, refinement, and cross-team coordination.

> _The Integrator supports every department by aligning software, workflows, and physical systems to ISO requirements, lean principles, and business goals. They also serve as the right hand of the Innovator, bridging creative strategy with on-the-ground execution._

- Design and implement lean systems that improve visibility, traceability, and efficiency  
- Troubleshoot cross-department workflows and unblock operational bottlenecks  
- Collaborate with all departments to ensure digital and physical tools serve real-world needs  
- Maintain technical oversight of the ERP, app integrations, and communication systems  
- Act as liaison between abstract goals (Innovator) and working systems (Operations, Admin, etc.)  
- Ensure quality, traceability, and process consistency across implementations  
- Support continual improvement by identifying friction and delivering long-term solutions
- Heavily supports R&D
