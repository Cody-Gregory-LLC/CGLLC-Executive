# Engineering / R&D Department

---

## 📌 **Purpose**

The **Engineering / R&D Department** is responsible for the technical development, process innovation, and continuous improvement of product designs, equipment setups, and production methods.  
It provides the bridge between **design intent** and **floor execution**, ensuring all tooling, jigs, and workflows are optimized for quality, efficiency, and safety.

> _Engineering collaborates closely with the **Innovator** on product development concepts and with the **Integrator** to implement process improvements in digital systems or tooling. Documentation generated here becomes the foundation for SOPs used by Operations and QA._

---

## 🎯 **Primary Objectives**

- Design and improve tools, fixtures, and shop processes based on performance data and user feedback  
- Prototype new tooling or modifications that improve safety, efficiency, or manufacturability  
- Support Operations with work instructions, CAD files, technical drawings, and part specifications  
- Validate and standardize methods for forging, grinding, machining, and stamping  
- Identify and correct production bottlenecks or tooling issues  
- Maintain revision control and traceability for all engineered parts and fixtures  
- Evaluate feasibility of new ideas from Innovator or Operations using data and modeling
